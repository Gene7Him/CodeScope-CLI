# explain-file.js

Let's break down this JavaScript file and what it does.

**What is this file?**

This file exports a single function called `explainFile`. It's a utility that helps you understand the purpose of a file or directory by asking CodeScope AI (a machine learning model) to explain its contents.

**Functionality**

Here's how the `explainFile` function works:

1. **Take in input**: The function takes two inputs: `fileOrDir` and `options`. `fileOrDir` is either a single file or directory path, while `options` is an object that contains some settings (more on this later).
2. **Determine if it's a file or dir**: If the provided `fileOrDir` is a directory, the function uses two helper functions (`walkDir` and `filterFiles`) to scan all files within it. If it's a single file, it just adds that to the list.
3. **Loop through each file/file(s)**: The function then loops through each file (or files) found in the input directory or passed as individual files.
4. **Read the code**: For each file, it reads the contents and extracts the file extension (e.g., `.js`, `.json`, etc.).
5. **Prompt CodeScope AI**: It uses a prompt to ask CodeScope AI to explain what the file does, passing in the file's code as input.
6. **Get the explanation**: The function waits for CodeScope AI to respond with an explanation and logs it to the console.
7. **Output options**:
	* If `output` is set to `'markdown'`, it saves the explanation as a Markdown-formatted file with the same name but with a `.md` extension.

**Key settings**

When you call `explainFile`, you can pass an object with two important settings:

* `options.filter`: an array of file extensions (or regex patterns) that should be excluded from the explanations.
* `options.output`: either `'markdown'` or any other value. If set to `'markdown'`, the function saves the explanation as a Markdown file.

**Example usage**

To use this function, simply require it and call it with a file path and optional settings:

```javascript
const explainFile = require('./explain-file.js');

explainFile('/path/to/file.js', {
  output: 'markdown',
});
```

This will ask CodeScope AI to explain the contents of `/path/to/file.js` as if to a junior developer, save the explanation in Markdown format, and print it to the console.
